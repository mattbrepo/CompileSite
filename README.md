# CompileSite
Simple static site generator in Python. It uses [Notepad++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) language highlight file (_langs.model.xml_) to represent code syntax.

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2014**

## Why
I was trying to build what I later found out it's called [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system#Static_site_generators). Fortunately, before I went too far I discovered the wonderful [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)).
